# 
TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).


## Final Product

### Main URL Page after you login
- This shows all the shortened URL that the user created
- On this page, you can edit and delete the shortened URL 

!["URL Main Page"](images/urlMain.png)

### Edit Window
- The edit window will show the long URL and the shortened URL. By clicking on the short URL, it will redirect you to the URL you want to be shortened.
- You can also edit the long URL and assign it to a new URL.
